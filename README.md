🌌 Gadget Galaxy | My SQL Skill-Building Lab

Welcome! This repository is my personal space for sharpening my SQL problem-solving skills. Using a custom-built database called Gadget Galaxy, I tackle various data challenges to move from basic queries to advanced analysis.


The Training Ground
To get the most out of my practice, I built a realistic environment:
🏗️ The Setup: The core SQL code used to build the tables.
💾 The Data: Real-world style values I've added to test my logic.
🧠 The Problems: My collection of SQL challenges and the solutions I’ve written.


Why I’m Doing This
I believe the best way to learn is by doing. This repo helps me:
Master Complex Logic: Moving beyond simple SELECT statements to joins, subqueries, and beyond.
Think Like an Analyst: Solving problems that a real business would face.
Track My Progress: Watching my code get cleaner and more efficient over time.
